# ABOUT ME 
![Branching](Headshot.jpg)


Hello Everyone,

My name is Ryan Moreno. I am currently Technical Support Analyst, and although I am at the beginning of my professional career, I have always had a deep interest in technology. Previously, I worked in finance, and while I gained valuable experience in that field, my passion for technology motivated me to transition to a tech-focused career.

I started my professional journey in early 2024 and have since earned certifications in Google Cybersecurity and CompTIA Security+. I am currently pursuing my CompTIA Network+ certification. Given the ever-evolving nature of technology, I stay informed about industry trends through podcasts such as CyberWire and Darknet Diaries.

I have a keen interest in various areas of technology, including SOC analysis, software engineering, networking, and hardware. My enthusiasm for technology drives my continuous learning and growth in this dynamic field.

## PROJECTS

#### PODCAST

To stay up-to-date with the latest in cybersecurity, I regularly listen to "CyberWire Daily." Additionally, I am an avid listener of "Darknet Diaries," and I am currently on episode 65 out of 159.
