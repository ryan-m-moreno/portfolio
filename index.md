![Branching](Headshot.jpg)


Hello Everyone,

My name is Ryan Moreno. I am currently IT Help Desk Coordinator, and although I am at the beginning of my professional career, I have always had a deep interest in technology. Previously, I worked in finance, and while I gained valuable experience in that field, my passion for technology motivated me to transition to a tech-focused career.

I started my professional journey in early 2024 and have since earned certifications in Google Cybersecurity. I am currently pursuing my CompTIA Security+ certification. Given the ever-evolving nature of technology, I stay informed about industry trends through podcasts such as CyberWire and Darknet Diaries.

I have a keen interest in various areas of technology, including SOC analysis, software engineering, networking, and hardware. My enthusiasm and curiosity for technology drives my continuous learning and growth in this dynamic field.

Building my own PC was an exhilarating experience that allowed me to tailor a powerful machine to meet my specific needs. I began by carefully researching the latest components, focusing on performance and compatibility. After selecting a high-end processor, a robust graphics card, and ample RAM, I meticulously assembled the system, ensuring optimal airflow and cable management.
