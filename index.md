Hello Everyone,

My name is Ryan Moreno. My most recent role was as an IT Help Desk Coordinator, where I developed hands-on experience supporting technology solutions and end users. Although I am at the early stages of my professional career, I have always had a strong interest in technology. Prior to transitioning into IT, I worked in the finance, where I gained valuable analytical and problem-solving skills. However, my passion for technology ultimately led me to pursue a more tech-focused path, aligning my career with my long-standing interests and strengths.

I started my professional journey in early 2024 and have since earned certifications in Google Cybersecurity. I am currently pursuing my CompTIA Networking+ and Security+ certification. Given the ever-evolving nature of technology, I stay informed about industry trends through podcasts such as CyberWire and Darknet Diaries.

I have a strong interest in various areas of technology, and my enthusiasm and curiosity continuously drive my learning and professional development in this dynamic field.

PROJECTS

Building my own PC was an exhilarating experience that allowed me to tailor a powerful machine to meet my specific needs. I began by carefully researching the latest components, focusing on performance and compatibility. After selecting a high-end processor, a robust graphics card, and ample RAM, I meticulously assembled the system, ensuring optimal airflow and cable management. The culmination of this project was not only the satisfaction of creating a custom setup but also the impressive performance I achieved, enabling seamless multitasking. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of computer hardware and solidified my passion for technology.

In my recent project, I developed a comprehensive Security Operations Center (SOC) using a virtual machine, which streamlined the entire setup while maximizing efficiency. I configured the virtual machine to host a dedicated operating system where I deployed a honeypot to lure and capture malicious activity, allowing me to analyze attack vectors and techniques in a controlled environment. Additionally, I integrated a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system that aggregated and correlated logs from the honeypot. This project not only provided valuable insights into potential security threats but also demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing a functional SOC.
